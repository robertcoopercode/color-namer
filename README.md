If you enter **#fb8a70**, you'll receive the name of **SALMON NIGIRI** along with the hex and rgb color representations, which would be **#fb8a70** and **rgb(251, 138, 112)**, respectively.

My answer: _"
Who the hell knows? ü§∑‚Äç"_

- **["Sass Color Variables That Don't Suck" - Landon Schropp](https://davidwalsh.name/sass-color-variables-dont-suck)** - This article outlines how I follow naming variables in my code and it requires many different names for colors, which is what motivated me to build this
